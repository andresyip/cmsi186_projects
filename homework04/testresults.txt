CLOCK CLASS TESTER PROGRAM
--------------------------

  Creating a new clock: 
    New clock created: 6:41 and 5.5 seconds.
    The angle between hands is 45.95833333333334
    Testing validateAngleArg()....
      sending '33.0 degrees ', expecting double value 33.0. - got 33.0

   Welcome to the Clock Solver Program

   You must at least the first argument.
     The first number will be the reference angle.
     The second number will be the slice of time the clock will tick.
     The last number will be the range of degrees the angle may be from the refence angle.
   If the process takes too long, enter q to quit.
   Please try again. The program will now quit.
